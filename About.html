Im a student at bournemouth university, studying game <br>
software engineering. My name is Toby Payne and im 19 <br>
years old. This website is currently just a small     <br>
project to show what i can do in html, and to test my <br>
skills. If you head to the projects page you can play <br>
a simple breakout style game, except there isnt any   <br>
bricks. This website will be updated as i get more    <br>
stuff to show off, so check back sometime, and it     <br>
might have changed! Meanwhile you can press this      <br>
to play some sound!                                   <br>
